# mklinks.sh - materialize the avx2/ and avx512/ backend trees by relative
# symlinking the SHARED scalar source from ref/, skipping the per-backend FORK
# set (Overview 3 / P01-T10).
#
# ref/ is the single source of truth.  At the M6 byte-exactness milestone the
# ONLY genuine forks/AVX-only files per backend are:
#   - config.h        (real fork: _avx2 / _avx512 namespace tail)
#   - poly_ntt.c      (real SIMD fork: hard-codes the AVX NTT signature families
#                      + signed canonicalization; the scalar ref/poly_ntt.c is
#                      NOT symlinked)
#   - the AVX-only / N-way XOF files: fips202x4/x8.*, f1600x4.S,
#     keccakf1600x8.c, symmetric_avx2/512.c, the SM3 N-way auxfunc_avx2/512.* +
#     drng_avx2/512.*, sm3_const.h / gen_sm3_const.py
#   - the per-qset vendored NTT asm dirs (q15361n256/, q61441n512/,
#     q59393n1024/ -- handled as directories, never file-by-file)
#
# EVERYTHING else is a relative symlink `ln -s ../ref/<f>` -- including the
# would-be-fork scalar sources (sampler.c polyvec.c irs.c rounding.c sign.c)
# and the NGCC infra (SIG_AlgorithmInstance.{c,h}, KAT_SIG.c, drng.{c,h},
# auxfunc.{c,h}, README.txt).  At M6 the backends = scalar scheme logic + SIMD
# NTT (poly_ntt.c fork + vendored asm) + SIMD XOF (the N-way files); the SIMD
# sampler/polyvec/rounding perf kernels are a LATER milestone (M9).  Until then
# the symlinked scalar .c is the running implementation, and -DUSE_AVX2_* /
# -DUSE_AVX512_* only route the NTT shim (poly_ntt.c) and the (currently
# unbuilt) SIMD kernels; the scalar bodies are byte-exact, so symlinking them
# is what makes the avx2/avx512 KAT hash equal the ref hash.
#
# This script is IDEMPOTENT and re-runnable: it (re)creates only the symlinks
# for shared files that actually exist in ref/ right now and are not in the
# fork/skip set, and never clobbers a real (non-symlink) file in a backend dir.
# As later plans add shared sources to ref/, re-running this picks them up.
#
# Run from anywhere:  sh tools/mklinks.sh   (or: cd tools && sh mklinks.sh)
